# OpenWork Start

You are an agent helping a user install and set up OpenWork.

Goal: install OpenWork, create or sign in to an OpenWork Cloud account, create a
workspace organization, invite a teammate, create a first skill, prepare the
desktop app with that account/org/skill, and verify the running app opens already
signed in.

> The bootstrap command is `openwork-bootstrap` (NOT `openwork`). The bare
> `openwork` command belongs to the separate `openwork-orchestrator` package and
> may already be on the user's PATH — do not use it for these steps.

## 1. Install CLI

Install the `openwork-bootstrap` CLI into a user-writable bin dir.

If you already have this repository locally:

```bash
node packages/openwork-bootstrap/bin/openwork.mjs install \
  --install-dir "$HOME/.openwork/bootstrap" \
  --bin-dir "$HOME/.local/bin" \
  --json
```

In production, download the bootstrap script, inspect it, then run it. Do not
pipe remote scripts directly into a shell. The script downloads the
`openwork-bootstrap` CLI (a single dependency-free Node file) and installs it
into `$HOME/.local/bin` — no npm or npx required.

```bash
curl -fsSLo /tmp/openwork-install.sh https://openworklabs.com/install.sh
less /tmp/openwork-install.sh
sh /tmp/openwork-install.sh
```

Verify:

```bash
openwork-bootstrap doctor --json
```

## 2. Install App

Install the desktop app for this OS from the manifest:

```bash
openwork-bootstrap install app \
  --manifest https://openworklabs.com/install-manifest.json \
  --json
```

Verify:

```bash
openwork-bootstrap doctor --app --json
```

## 3. Create Cloud Workspace

Ask the user for:

- owner email
- workspace name
- teammate email to invite

Generate a strong password locally unless the user provides one. Do not print the
password or token in the final response.

```bash
OPENWORK_OWNER_PASSWORD="<generated-password>" \
openwork-bootstrap cloud onboard \
  --base-url https://app.openworklabs.com \
  --owner-email "<owner-email>" \
  --org-name "<workspace-name>" \
  --invite-email "<teammate-email>" \
  --skill-name "First OpenWork Skill" \
  --prepare-desktop \
  --json
```

## 4. Success Criteria

You are done only when all are true:

- `openwork-bootstrap doctor --json` returns `ok: true`
- `openwork-bootstrap doctor --app --json` returns `ok: true`
- `openwork-bootstrap cloud onboard ... --json` returns:
  - `ok: true`
  - `organization.id` is present
  - `invitation.invitationId` is present
  - `skill.id` is present
  - `skillRun.triggered` is `true`
  - `skillRun.output` is `OPENWORK_BOOTSTRAP_SKILL_TRIGGERED`
  - `desktop.prepared` is `true`
  - `desktop.bootstrapPath` is present
  - `desktop.skillPath` is present
- `openwork-bootstrap doctor --desktop-bootstrap --json` returns `ok: true`
- When the desktop app is launched, it opens already signed in and lands on the
  onboarding screen showing a green "Setup complete" banner, the organization
  name, and a "First skill ready" tile with the skill created by the CLI.

## 5. If Something Fails

- If CLI install fails: report OS, shell, command, and stderr.
- If the `openwork-bootstrap` command is not found after install: ensure
  `$HOME/.local/bin` is on PATH, or call the binary by its full path
  (`$HOME/.local/bin/openwork-bootstrap`).
- If app install fails: run `openwork-bootstrap doctor --app --json` and report failed checks.
- If signup says the email already exists: ask the user whether to sign in instead.
- If invite accept returns `email_verification_required`: tell the invited user to verify email before joining.

## 6. Constraints

- Do not require admin privileges.
- Prefer user-local install paths.
- Do not print passwords or tokens in final output.
- Report exactly what was installed and where.

## 7. Security note: desktop preparation

`--prepare-desktop` writes a one-time, short-lived (~5 minute) desktop sign-in
grant to a machine-local `desktop-bootstrap.json`. The grant is never printed.
On first launch the desktop app exchanges it once and rewrites the file without
the grant, so it cannot be reused. This file is local-only; do not copy it
between machines or commit it.
