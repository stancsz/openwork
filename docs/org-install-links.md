# Organization Install Links

## What it is

Organization install links let org admins mint shareable desktop install links
for their workspace. Den serves one generic signed installer and stamps it per
org at serve time. The installed app boots into forced sign-in against your
deployment, so possession of an install link does not grant workspace access.

## Upgrade checklist

> **Dark launch:** Upgrading changes nothing visible. Install links stay dark
> until a platform admin enables the `Install links` capability for an org.

### Helm

1. Keep `migrations.enabled=true` for the upgrade. The migration Job creates
   the `install_link` table automatically; see the
   [Helm migration Job docs](../packaging/helm/openwork-ee/README.md#migrations).
2. Set `config.public.bootstrapAdminEmails` (renders
   `DEN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS`) to the platform admin email allowlist.
3. Restart/roll the deployment with the new values.
4. Sign in to den-web, open `/admin`, and toggle `Install links` for each org
   that should be allowed to mint links.

### Docker Compose

1. Run the migration once from the repo root:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f packaging/docker/docker-compose.den-dev.yml exec den sh -lc "pnpm --dir /app/ee/packages/den-db run db:bootstrap"
   ```

   If your stack was launched with a custom Compose project name, include the
   same `-p <project>` flag.
2. Set `DEN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` on the Den API service, then restart it.
3. Sign in to den-web, open `/admin`, and toggle `Install links` for each org
   that should be allowed to mint links.

## Trusted origins requirement

> **Hard requirement:** The first entry of
> `DEN_BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` must be your den-web origin (for example,
> `https://openwork.example.com`). Minted install links and invitation links
> are both built from that origin.

## Installer artifacts

Den resolves Mac and Windows installer artifacts in this order:

1. `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_ARTIFACTS_DIR`, when set and the file exists.
2. `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_CACHE_DIR/<tag>/<file>`, defaulting to the OS temp dir.
3. The GitHub release asset for `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_RELEASE_REPO` and
   `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_RELEASE_TAG`.

| Mode | Configure | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Internet-connected | Default. `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_RELEASE_TAG` resolves to `v<pinned app version>`; override it when needed. `v0.17.9` is the first tag carrying installer assets. | Den downloads the public release asset on first Mac/Windows download, then serves cached bytes. |
| Fork/mirror | Set `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_RELEASE_REPO`, for example `your-org/openwork`. | Den downloads assets from your fork or mirror release instead of `different-ai/openwork`. |
| Air-gapped | Mount a volume at `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_ARTIFACTS_DIR` containing exactly `openwork-installer-mac-arm64.zip`, `openwork-installer-mac-x64.zip`, and `openwork-installer-win-x64.exe`. | The mounted artifact directory takes precedence and requires zero egress. |

## Egress

`den-api` makes outbound HTTPS requests to `github.com` only when serving a Mac
or Windows installer download and the artifact is not already cached. The Linux
setup script and every other install-link feature need no egress.

## Distribute configuration with MDM (no custom installer)

You can deploy the standard public OpenWork desktop installer and point it at
your self-hosted control plane by managing one JSON file. No custom installer is
required.

OpenWork reads `desktop-bootstrap.json` from the same canonical path used by the
installer and bootstrap CLI:

| OS | Canonical path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\openwork\desktop-bootstrap.json` (`%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%\openwork\desktop-bootstrap.json` wins first if your environment sets it) |
| macOS/Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openwork/desktop-bootstrap.json`, falling back to `~/.config/openwork/desktop-bootstrap.json` |

Older desktop builds also wrote `~/.config/openwork/desktop-bootstrap.json` on
every OS. Current builds still read that legacy file for compatibility; when
both files exist and parse, the config with the newest `writtenAt` timestamp
wins. If `writtenAt` is missing or invalid, OpenWork falls back to the file
mtime for that file. When the legacy file wins, OpenWork migrates it to the
canonical path. The installer also cleans up a stale legacy twin after writing
the canonical file.

Schema:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://openwork.example.com",
  "apiBaseUrl": "https://api.openwork.example.com",
  "requireSignin": true,
  "writtenAt": "2026-07-07T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- `baseUrl` is required and should be your den-web origin.
- `apiBaseUrl` is optional when your web origin proxies Den API traffic, but is
  recommended for split web/API deployments.
- `requireSignin` should be `true` for organization-managed installs.
- `writtenAt` should be an ISO timestamp; use a fresh value whenever MDM rolls
  out a replacement config so the newest file wins deterministically.

For MDM tools such as ManageEngine, deploy the public installer, then write this
file to the canonical path for each user profile. The public installer plus this
managed file is enough for a fully self-hosted desktop rollout.

## Security notes

- Install-link tokens are stored SHA-256 hashed.
- Minting a new link rotates by default and revokes older active links.
- A leaked link reveals the org name and server URLs only; users still must
  sign in to access the workspace.
- Public install-link endpoints are rate-limited.
- Stamped Mac zips keep the signed `.app` byte-identical, so Gatekeeper
  verification still applies.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `503` mentions a release tag | That release has no installer assets. Pin `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_RELEASE_TAG` to a tag with assets, or publish them with the `release-generic-installer` workflow. |
| Links point at the wrong host | Put your den-web origin first in `DEN_BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, then restart `den-api`. |
| Re-uploaded assets under the same tag keep serving old bytes | Clear the installer cache directory or bump the tag. The cache key is `<cacheDir>/<tag>/<file>`. |
